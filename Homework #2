# Homework #2
Cynthia I. Rodriguez
## Exercise 1
Ask a question that requires a student to understand navigation and manipulation of directories in a filesystem. Your question should require an answer using at least the following commands/concepts: cd, ../, mkdir, rmdir

### Instructions for undergraduate:
> Please create a directory in your home directory with the name of your project and create the following subdirectories: data, temporary, protocols, and final.

### ANSWER:
``` 
mkdir /homedirectory/mkdir myproject
mkdir /homedirectory/myproject/mkdir data
mkdir /homedirectory/myproject/mkdir temporary
mkdir /homedirectory/myproject/mkdir protocols
mkdir /homedirectory/myproject/mkdir final
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
> Go into your project directory and once inside delete the subdirectory called "protocols".
```
cd  /homedirectory/myproject
rmdir protocols
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
> *Back up to the home directory and create a new directory called experiments
### ANSWER:
```
cd ../
mkdir experiments
```

## Exercise 2
Ask a question that requires a student to understand the difference between accessing a column in a matrix with numeric indices versus accessing a column in a data frame with numeric indices. Your question should require an answer comparing the following: mymatrix[,1] vs. mydf[,1] vs. mydf[1] vs. mydf[[1]].

### Instructions for undergraduate:
> Please create a matrix in R that has 4 columns and 3 rows with the numbers 1 through 12. The numbers should go down per columns. Then visualize the data matrix.

### ANSWER:
```
mymatrix <- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
mymatrix
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
>Subset data from the matrix by getting only the first column of such matrix as a vector:
### ANSWER:
```
> mymatrix[,1]
[1] 1 2 3
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
>Now subset only the 3rd value of the matrix:
### ANSWER:
```
> mymatrix[3]
[1] 3
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
>Subset the same value with a different command:
### ANSWER:
```
> mymatrix[[3]]
[1] 3
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
> Now load the following dataframe into RStudio (from csv format) and visualize your dataframe:
```
Name	Age	Color
Laura	10	green
Paco	12	blue
Tony	11	yellow
Jen	    16	pink
```
### ANSWER:
```
mydf <-read.csv('mydf.csv')
mydf
```
### Instructions for undergraduate:
> Now try the same commands you performed for the matrix on this dataframe and explain what are the differences you obtain:
### ANSWER:
```
> mydf[,1]
[1] Laura Paco  Tony  Jen  
Levels: Jen Laura Paco Tony
#The characters of the first column get converted into a factors (numbers)- it has stored the factor information as a vector.

> mydf[3]
   color
1  green
2   blue
3 yellow
4   pink
#Running this command on the matrix subsetted only the 3rd value of the matrix; however, when you run the same command on the dataframe it gets you the 3rd column of the dataframe.

> mydf[[3]]
[1] green  blue   yellow pink  
Levels: blue green pink yellow
#Running this command on the matrix subsetted only the 3rd value of the matrix; however, when you run the same command on the dataframe it gets you the 3rd column of the dataframe as a vector.
```

## Exercise 3
Ask a question that requires a student to understand how to share access to a directory and a file in that directory on a Unix/Linux filesystem from their home directory with a colleague without exposing the user's entire directory. Your question should require an answer using chmod {u,g,o}{+,-}{r,w,x} (not using octal permissions).

### Instructions for undergraduate:
You need to share access to a folder named bacteria within your home directory with a colleague and one of its files named microbes. Make sure you do not share the entire directory's contents. Make sure your collegue can access the file and see it but cannot modify it.
### ANSWER:
```
chmod o+x /homedirectory
chmod o+x /homedirectory/bacteria
cd home/bacteria
chmod o+r microbes
#OR instead of entering the directory "bacteria" you can grant access directly by listing the whole path to the file:
chmod o+r /homedirectory/bacteria/microbes
```
